code for ths problem statement  "It has been conjectured that every even integer can be written as the difference of two 
consecutive primes in infinitely many ways. For example, 6 = 29- 23 = 137- 131 = 599- 593 = 1019- 1013 = ... 
Express the integer 10 as the difference of two consecutive primes in 15 ways."
